# 🌪️ ASTRO-NEXUS OVERDRIVE 🌪️
### "The Most Lethal Discord Raider & Management Setup Ever Built."

---

## 🚀 What is ASTRO-NEXUS?
Imagine you have a remote control that doesn't just change TV channels, but can control an entire army of digital robots. That’s **ASTRO-NEXUS**. It’s a "Raider Machine" built to manage, test, and—if needed—bring pure chaos to Discord servers using an army of accounts (called Tokens).

---

## 🧪 Rocket Science (Explained for a 10-Year-Old)

### 1. What are Tokens? 🔑
Think of a **Token** as a secret "Digital Key". When you log into Discord, you use a password. But once you're in, Discord gives you a Token so you don't have to keep typing your password. 
*   **The Power:** If you have 100 Tokens, you have 100 people ready to follow your orders instantly!

### 2. What are Proxies? 🎭
Imagine you're playing Hide and Seek, but you can change your face and clothes every second. That’s a **Proxy**. Discord is smart—it knows if 100 people are coming from the same house (your IP address) and might block you. 
*   **The Power:** Proxies give every "robot" a different house and face, so Discord thinks they are all real people from all over the world!

### 3. What is the API? 🔌
Discord is like a giant library. The **API** is the librarian. Instead of using the mouse and keyboard, ASTRO-NEXUS talks directly to the librarian in secret code. 
*   **The Power:** This is way faster than any human. It’s like being able to read 1,000 books at the same time!

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step: Fueling the Machine (Installation)

Before the machine can fly, it needs "Liquid Fuel" (Libraries). This is the **Rocket Science** part that makes everything work. Don't worry, it's easier than Lego!

### 1. The Magic Box (Python) 🐍
You need Python installed. It's the engine. Without it, the machine is just a dead piece of code.
*   **Check it:** Open your terminal (cmd/powershell) and type `python --version`.
*   **Get it:** If it's not there, grab it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure to check the box that says **"Add Python to PATH"** (Very important!).

### 2. The Fuel Delivery System (Pip) 🚚
**Pip** is a tiny robot inside your computer that goes to the internet, finds the libraries we need, and installs them for you.
*   The machine uses a file called `requirements.txt`. This is basically a **"Grocery List"** of all the fuel we need.

### 3. Loading the Fuel (The Command) ⚡
Open your Terminal exactly where you have downloaded ASTRO-NEXUS and type this **Alpha Command**:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Why are we doing this? (Rocket Science Breakdown):
*   **`requests` & `tls-client`**: These are the "Stealthed Engines". They allow the tokens to talk to Discord without getting caught by the guards. 🕵️‍♂️
*   **`colorama`**: This adds the "Rainbow Fire" to your terminal. Without it, everything would be boring black and white. 🌈
*   **`websocket-client`**: This is the "Submarine Cable". It connects the tokens to Discord's live heartbeat so they can hear sounds and see calls. 🔊
*   **`uuid` & `json`**: These are the "ID Card Machines". They create unique names and data formats so Discord thinks every token is a real human. 🆔

### 4. Troubleshooting (If it fails) 🛠️
*   **"Pip is not recognized"**: This means the robot is hiding. Restart your computer or reinstall Python with the "Add to PATH" box checked!
*   **"Access Denied"**: The computer's security is blocking the robot. Try using `pip install -r requirements.txt --user` or run your terminal as **Administrator**.
*   **"Connection Timeout"**: Your internet is being slow. Check your wifi and try again!

---

## 🛠️ How to Start the Machine

1.  **Install Python**: Download from python.org.
2.  **Add Your Tools**:
    *   Put your tokens in `data/tokens.txt`.
    *   Put your proxies in `data/proxies.txt` (or use **Option 45** to let the machine do it!).
3.  **Run the Strike**:
    ```bash
    python "ASTRO-NEXUS Raider.py"
    ```
4.  **Use Option 'h'**: If you ever get lost, press **'h'** for the Master Guide inside the script!

## 💀 Final Warning
"With great power comes great... chaos." 
ASTRO-NEXUS is built for **speed**, **stealth**, and **destruction**. Use it wisely, or don't. The machine doesn't care.
